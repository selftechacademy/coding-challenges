// --- Directions
// Given a string, return the character that is most
// commonly used in the string.
// --- Examples
// maxChar("abcccccccd") === "c"
// maxChar("apple 1231111") === "1"

//NOTE:This solution will be also good for questions like?
/*
1. What is the most common character in the string
2. Does String A has same characters as B?
3.Does that character have any repeated characters in it?
